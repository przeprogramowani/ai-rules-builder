By creating an account, the user consents to the processing of their data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 6. Method and Location of Processing

- The application is hosted on Cloudflare infrastructure, which may use servers in various locations, including outside the European Economic Area.
- Data is stored in the Supabase database located in the eu-central-1 region (Frankfurt, Germany), which means that the main user data remains within the European Union.

## 7. Data Retention Period

Users' personal data is stored for the period of having an active account in the 10xRules.ai application. After deleting the account, the data is permanently removed from our systems, with the exception of data that may be stored longer due to applicable law (e.g., billing data).

## 8. Data Recipients

User data is not shared with any external companies besides the service providers necessary for the application to function:

- Supabase – provider of database and authentication services
- Cloudflare – provider of hosting and security services

The listed service providers have access to user data only to the extent necessary to provide their services and are subject to appropriate data protection obligations.

## 9. Transfer of Data to Third Countries

In connection with the use of Cloudflare services, some data may be processed on servers located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). In such cases, we ensure that data transfer takes place with appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.

## 10. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

The 10xRules.ai application uses basic cookies necessary for the proper functioning of the application, in particular for managing user sessions and ensuring security. These cookies are necessary for using the application and do not require separate user consent in accordance with legal regulations.
