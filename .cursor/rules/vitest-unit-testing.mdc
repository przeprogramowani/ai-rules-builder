## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### VITEST

- Leverage the vi object for mocks and spies
- If you are using "vi.mock" factory, make sure there are no top level variables inside, since this call is hoisted to top of the file.
- Use the setup files for global test configuration
- Leverage the inline snapshot feature for small snapshots
- Implement coverage reporting with @vitest/coverage-v8 integration
- Use the watch mode for development
- Leverage the UI mode for interactive test exploration
- Implement mocking for optional modules and dependencies
- Use jsdom for DOM testing environment
