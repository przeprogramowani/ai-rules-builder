## Github Action Rules

### Version Verification

1. Identify public actions used within the workflow
2. For each action always check what is the most up-to-date version with the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"v([0-9]+).*/\1/'
```

### Setup Node

Always check the existence of `.nvmrc` in the project to make sure Node is correctly set up (hardcoded LTS or version from file - if it exists).
