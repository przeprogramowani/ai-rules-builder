---

## Test Infrastructure Analysis

### Mock Supabase Client (`tests/helpers/mockSupabaseClient.ts`)

**Value: ★★★★★ (9/10)**
- Provides comprehensive, reusable mock for all Supabase query operations
- Supports method chaining, matching real Supabase client behavior
- Type-safe with proper TypeScript integration
- Includes role-based factory functions (`createMemberMockClient`, `createAdminMockClient`)

**Maintenance Cost: ★★★☆☆ (3/10)**
- Well-abstracted, single point of change for mock behavior
- Self-documenting with clear JSDoc comments
- Minimal dependencies, unlikely to break with upgrades

**Key Insight:** This is a **force multiplier** - the investment in building this mock pays dividends across all service tests. It eliminates 80% of boilerplate that would otherwise be scattered across test files.

**Recommendation:** ✅ Keep as-is. Consider documenting common usage patterns in a test README.

---

### Test Fixtures (`tests/fixtures/promptManagerFixtures.ts`)

**Value: ★★★★☆ (8/10)**
- Centralized test data ensures consistency across test suites
- Domain-organized (organizations, users, collections, segments, prompts)
- Helper functions for filtered queries simulate real-world data access patterns
- Simulates RLS (Row-Level Security) behavior for different user roles

**Maintenance Cost: ★★☆☆☆ (2/10)**
- Pure data structure, minimal logic to maintain
- Changes to domain models will require updates, but TypeScript catches these
- Well-organized with clear naming conventions

**Potential Issues:**
- ⚠️ Fixture data grows stale if not actively used - some fixtures may be unused
- ⚠️ Implicit dependencies between fixtures (e.g., org IDs referenced in prompts)

**Recommendation:** ✅ Keep and expand. Periodically audit for unused fixtures. Consider adding validation to ensure fixture relationships are correct.

---

## Unit Test Analysis

### 1. Invites Service (`tests/unit/services/prompt-manager/invites.test.ts`)

**Value: ★★★★★ (10/10)**
```
Coverage:
- Token generation (uniqueness, format)
- Invite creation (with/without max uses, different roles)
- Token validation (all error cases: expired, revoked, max uses, invalid)
- Invite listing and revocation
- Statistics retrieval with user details
```

**Why High Value:**
- Tests **critical security logic** - invite tokens control org access
- Validates all business rules: expiration, max uses, revocation
- Tests error handling comprehensively
- Each test is atomic and focused on single behavior

**Maintenance Cost: ★★★☆☆ (3/10)**
- Moderate mock setup required (10-30 lines per test)
- Each test manually constructs query builder chains
- Changes to service signatures require updates across multiple tests

**Example of Good Test Design:**
```typescript
it('rejects an expired invite', async () => {
  const mockInvite = {
    // ... clear test data
    expires_at: new Date(Date.now() - 86400000).toISOString(), // 1 day ago
    is_active: true,
    // ...
  };

  // Simple, focused assertion
  expect(validationResult.valid).toBe(false);
  expect(validationResult.error).toBe(INVITE_ERROR_MESSAGES.INVITE_EXPIRED);
});
```

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Tests business rules, not implementation details
- ✅ Clear test names describe exact scenario
- ✅ Good coverage of edge cases (empty token, null values, etc.)

**Improvement Opportunities:**
- 🔧 Mock setup is repetitive - could extract builder pattern for common scenarios
- 🔧 Some tests could use table-driven approach for similar cases (e.g., different validation errors)

**Recommendation:** ✅ Keep with minor refactoring to reduce mock boilerplate.

---

### 2. Prompt Service (`tests/unit/services/prompt-manager/promptService.test.ts`)

**Value: ★★★★☆ (9/10)**
```
Coverage:
- CRUD operations (create, update, publish, unpublish, delete, get, list)
- Organization scoping enforcement
- Status transitions (draft → published → draft)
- Partial updates (only specified fields)
- Error handling (not found, DB errors, unexpected exceptions)
- Filtering (by status, collection, segment)
```

**Why High Value:**
- Tests **core domain logic** - prompts are the primary entity
- Validates critical authorization rules (organization scoping)
- Tests both happy paths and error cases
- Ensures data integrity during state transitions

**Maintenance Cost: ★★★★☆ (4/10)**
- **Heavy mock setup** - some tests have 15-20 lines of mock chaining
- Mock builder pattern is verbose: `eq → select → single → mockResolvedValue`
- Each CRUD operation requires similar but slightly different mock setup

**Example of Mock Complexity:**
```typescript
// This pattern repeats ~50 times across the file
const single = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: mockPrompt, error: null });
const select = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ single });
const eq2 = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ select });
const eq1 = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ eq: eq2 });
const update = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ eq: eq1 });
mockSupabase.from.mockReturnValue({ update });
```

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of all service methods
- ✅ Tests organization-level data isolation (critical for multi-tenant system)
- ✅ Validates error messages and codes (useful for debugging)
- ✅ Tests filtering logic with chainable query builders

**Pain Points:**
- ❌ Mock setup dominates test code (60-70% of lines are mocking)
- ❌ Hard to see what's actually being tested among the setup
- ❌ Brittle to changes in query builder chaining order

**Improvement Opportunities:**
- 🔧 **Extract mock builders**: Create helpers like `mockSelectSingle()`, `mockUpdate()`, etc.
- 🔧 **Use test fixtures more**: Replace inline mock data with fixture references
- 🔧 Consider higher-level abstractions: `mockSupabase.mockQuery('prompts').returns(mockPrompt)`

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ Keep but refactor urgently. Extract common mock patterns into helpers.

---

### 3. Collection Service (`tests/unit/services/prompt-manager/promptCollectionService.test.ts`)

**Value: ★★★★☆ (8/10)**
```
Coverage:
- Fetching collections and segments (with ordering)
- Creating collections and segments (with auto-incrementing sort_order)
- Organization filtering
- Error handling (DB errors, exceptions)
- Edge cases (empty results, null data)
```

**Why High Value:**
- Tests **structural integrity** - collections organize prompts hierarchically
- Validates sort order logic (critical for UI presentation)
- Tests default value handling (sort_order auto-increment)

**Maintenance Cost: ★★★★☆ (4/10)**
- Same mock complexity as promptService tests
- More complex mocking when testing sort_order auto-increment (2 DB calls)

**Example of Complex Test:**
```typescript
it('creates collection with default sort_order when not provided', async () => {
  // Mock 1: Get max sort_order
  const maxSingle = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: null, error: null });
  const maxLimit = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ single: maxSingle });
  // ... 4 more lines

  // Mock 2: Insert with calculated sort_order
  const insertSingle = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: mockCollection, error: null });
  // ... 3 more lines

  // Setup: Return different mocks for each call
  mockSupabase.from
    .mockReturnValueOnce({ select: maxSelect })
    .mockReturnValueOnce({ insert });
});
```

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Tests both explicit and implicit sort ordering
- ✅ Validates relationship integrity (collections → segments)
- ✅ Good exception handling tests

**Pain Points:**
- ❌ Multi-step operations require complex mock orchestration
- ❌ `.mockReturnValueOnce()` chains are hard to follow

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ Refactor to use builder pattern for multi-step operations.

---

### 4. Middleware (`tests/unit/middleware/promptManagerMiddleware.test.ts`)

**Value: ★★★★★ (10/10)**
```
Coverage:
- Authentication (redirects unauthenticated users)
- Feature flags (returns 404 when disabled)
- Organization membership checks
- Role-based authorization (admin vs member access)
- Context building and injection
```

**Why High Value:**
- Tests **critical security boundary** - prevents unauthorized access
- Validates feature flag behavior (important for deployment safety)
- Tests authorization at multiple levels (authentication, membership, role)
- Ensures context is correctly passed to downstream handlers

**Maintenance Cost: ★★☆☆☆ (2/10)**
- Clean, focused tests with minimal setup
- Good use of helper functions (`createContext`, `createUser`)
- Environment variable mocking is well-isolated

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ **Excellent separation of concerns** - each test validates one auth rule
- ✅ Tests actual middleware behavior, not implementation
- ✅ Verifies correct redirect behavior and status codes
- ✅ Uses dynamic module loading to test env-dependent behavior

**Recommendation:** ✅ Exemplary test suite. Use as template for other middleware tests.

## Integration Test Analysis

### 1. Invite Flow (`tests/integration/invite-flow.test.ts`)

**Value: ★★★★★ (10/10)**
```
Complete workflow coverage:
1. Admin creates invite link
2. Unauthenticated user validates invite
3. User signs up and redeems invite (auto-joins org)
4. Existing user also redeems same invite
5. Admin views invite statistics
6. Admin lists all invites
7. Admin revokes invite
8. Verify revoked invite cannot be validated
```

**Why Extremely High Value:**
- Tests **critical user journey** from end to end
- Validates invite system actually works as a cohesive whole
- Catches integration issues that unit tests miss
- Documents expected system behavior better than any documentation
- Tests idempotency (existing member redemption)

**Maintenance Cost: ★★★★☆ (4/10)**
- Long test (280 lines) but well-organized with clear steps
- Mock setup is complex but necessarily so (simulates full workflow)
- Changes to workflow require updating single test (good isolation)

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ **Self-documenting** - test reads like a user story
- ✅ Tests edge cases in context (expiry, max uses, revocation)
- ✅ Validates complete data flow through system
- ✅ Tests both new and existing user paths

**Valuable Pattern:**
```typescript
// Step comments make workflow crystal clear
// Step 1: Admin creates an invite link
const createResult = await createOrganizationInvite(...)
expect(createResult.error).toBeNull();

// Step 2: Unauthenticated user validates the invite
const validationResult = await validateInviteToken(...)
expect(validationResult.valid).toBe(true);
```

**Recommendation:** ✅ Keep as-is. This test provides immense value for confidence in the invite system.

---

### 2. Prompt Admin Flow (`tests/integration/prompt-admin-flow.test.ts`)

**Value: ★★★★★ (10/10)**
```
Complete admin workflow:
1. Fetch available collections
2. Fetch segments for collection
3. Create draft prompt
4. Update prompt content
5. Publish prompt
6. Verify in published list
7. Unpublish prompt
8. Verify back to draft
9. Delete prompt
10. Verify deletion
```

**Why Extremely High Value:**
- Tests **primary admin use case** from start to finish
- Validates state machine (draft → published → draft → deleted)
- Ensures collections/segments are properly integrated with prompts
- Tests that prompts appear/disappear from lists correctly based on status

**Maintenance Cost: ★★★★☆ (4/10)**
- Similar complexity to invite flow
- Well-structured with clear step comments

**Additional Test Cases:**
- ✅ Organization scoping enforcement (trying to access wrong org's data)
- ✅ Error handling (DB errors return proper error codes)

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Tests complete CRUD lifecycle in realistic sequence
- ✅ Validates list filtering by status
- ✅ Tests organization-level isolation (security-critical)

**Recommendation:** ✅ Keep as-is. Core workflow test that prevents regressions.

## Cross-Cutting Observations

### What's Working Well

1. **Clear Test Naming** - Every test name describes the exact behavior being tested
   - ✅ "rejects an expired invite"
   - ✅ "allows admin route for admin members"
   - ✅ "creates collection with default sort_order when not provided"

2. **Behavior-Focused, Not Implementation-Focused**
   - Tests validate **what** happens, not **how** it happens
   - Minimal coupling to internal implementation details
   - Tests would survive refactoring of internal logic

3. **Good Error Case Coverage**
   - Every service method tests both success and failure paths
   - Error codes and messages are validated (useful for API consumers)
   - Edge cases (null, empty, expired, revoked) are comprehensively tested

4. **Integration Tests Document User Journeys**
   - Integration tests serve as executable specifications
   - Step-by-step comments make workflows crystal clear
   - Tests validate that multiple services work together correctly

### Pain Points

1. **Mock Boilerplate Dominance** (★★★★★ High Impact)
   - 60-70% of test code is mock setup
   - Same patterns repeated 50+ times across files
   - Makes tests harder to read and maintain

   **Solution:** Extract mock builders
   ```typescript
   // Instead of:
   const single = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: mockPrompt, error: null });
   const select = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ single });
   const eq2 = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ select });
   const eq1 = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ eq: eq2 });
   const update = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ eq: eq1 });
   mockSupabase.from.mockReturnValue({ update });

   // Use:
   mockSupabase.whenUpdate('prompts').returns(mockPrompt);
   ```

2. **Test Data Inline vs Fixtures** (★★★☆☆ Medium Impact)
   - Some tests use fixtures, others create data inline
   - Inconsistent approach makes tests harder to understand
   - Inline data often duplicates fixture data

   **Solution:** Establish convention - use fixtures for common entities, inline for test-specific variations

3. **Multi-Step Mock Orchestration** (★★★☆☆ Medium Impact)
   - Tests with multiple DB calls require `.mockReturnValueOnce()` chains
   - Hard to track which mock applies to which call
   - Easy to get order wrong, causing confusing failures

   **Solution:** Add builder with explicit sequencing
   ```typescript
   mockSupabase
     .expectQuery('collections').toReturn(maxSortOrder)
     .expectInsert('collections').toReturn(newCollection);
   ```

---

## Maintenance Cost Drivers

### High Maintenance Risk Areas

1. **Query Builder Mock Chains** 🔴 High Risk
   - **Why:** Tightly coupled to Supabase query builder API
   - **Impact:** Any change to Supabase client requires updating 100+ mock chains
   - **Mitigation:** Abstract behind builder pattern

2. **Test Data Updates** 🟡 Medium Risk
   - **Why:** Domain model changes require updating fixtures and inline data
   - **Impact:** TypeScript catches most issues, but test assertions may need updates
   - **Mitigation:** Use type-safe fixture builders

3. **Mock Sequencing** 🟡 Medium Risk
   - **Why:** `.mockReturnValueOnce()` chains fragile to reordering
   - **Impact:** Adding new query in service breaks unrelated tests
   - **Mitigation:** Use explicit mock expectations with better error messages

### Low Maintenance Risk Areas

1. **Integration Tests** 🟢 Low Risk
   - Tests are high-level, don't care about implementation
   - Changes to internal logic don't affect tests
   - Only break when actual behavior changes (which is desired)

2. **Middleware Tests** 🟢 Low Risk
   - Small, focused tests with minimal dependencies
   - Test contract, not implementation
   - Helper functions isolate changes

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Extract Mock Builders** 🔧 Priority: HIGH
   ```typescript
   // Create tests/helpers/mockQueryBuilders.ts
   export function mockSelect<T>(client: MockSupabaseClient, data: T) {
     const single = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data, error: null });
     const select = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ single });
     const eq = vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ single });
     client.from.mockReturnValue({ select, eq });
   }
   ```
   **Impact:** Reduce test code by 40-50%, improve readability

2. **Document Mock Patterns** 📚 Priority: MEDIUM
   - Create `tests/README.md` with common mock patterns
   - Show examples of each builder function
   - Explain when to use fixtures vs inline data

3. **Audit Fixture Usage** 🔍 Priority: LOW
   - Identify unused fixtures (search for references)
   - Remove or update stale test data
   - Document fixture relationships

### Short-term Improvements (Month 1)

4. **Add RLS Verification Tests** 🔒 Priority: HIGH
   - Use Supabase local testing to verify RLS policies
   - Test that organization_id filtering actually prevents cross-org access
   - Validate that member vs admin roles enforce correctly

5. **Add Concurrency Tests** ⚡ Priority: MEDIUM
   - Test invite max_uses under concurrent redemptions
   - Test sort_order conflicts when creating collections simultaneously
   - Use Promise.all() to simulate parallel operations

6. **Improve Error Testing** ❌ Priority: LOW
   - Test transaction rollback scenarios
   - Verify partial failure handling (e.g., RPC fails but insert succeeds)
   - Add tests for database constraint violations

### Long-term Strategy

7. **Consider Contract Testing** 📋
   - Add Pact or similar for API contract verification
   - Ensure frontend and backend stay in sync

## Conclusion

### The Good ✅

This test suite demonstrates **excellent engineering judgment**:
- Tests focus on business-critical functionality (auth, invites, CRUD)
- Integration tests validate complete user workflows
- Clear, descriptive test names serve as documentation
- Good separation between unit and integration testing
- Robust test infrastructure (mock client, fixtures)

### The Improvement Opportunity ⚠️

The primary pain point is **mock boilerplate overhead**:
- 60-70% of test code is repetitive mock setup
- Same patterns repeated across 50+ tests
- Makes tests harder to write and maintain

**This is easily fixable** with helper functions and builder patterns.

### Final Assessment

**Keep: 100% of tests** ✅
**Refactor: 60% of tests** ⚠️ (reduce mock boilerplate)
**Delete: 0% of tests** ❌

**ROI: Excellent** - These tests provide high confidence in critical workflows with reasonable maintenance burden. The recommended refactoring will cut maintenance costs by ~40% while maintaining all current value.
