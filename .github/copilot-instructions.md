# AI Rules Builder

## Specification

This is a web application that enables developers to quickly create so called "rules for AI" used by tools such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor and Windsurf, through an interactive, visual interface.

Key business requirements include:

- The ability to visually build AI rule sets representing different project aspects (architecture, technologies, coding conventions);
- Intelligent suggestions for additional rules generated by AI based on user choices;
- Support for various output formats compatible with popular AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude);
- Capabilities to save, share, and import rule templates;
- A versioning system allowing for iterative refinement of rule sets;

## Tech Stack

- Astro 5
- TypeScript 5
- React 18.3
- Tailwind 4
- Zustand
- Lucide React (icons)

## Directory Structure

When introducing changes to the project, always follow the directory structure below:

- `./src` - source code
- `./src/layouts` - Astro layouts
- `./src/pages` - Astro pages
- `./src/pages/api` - API endpoints
- `./src/components` - client-side components written in Astro (static) and React (dynamic)
- `./src/store` - state management
- `./src/assets` - static internal assets
- `./public` - public assets

When modifying the directory structure, always update this section.

## Guidelines

- Use React for dynamic components and Astro for static components
- Unless the component requires interactivity, generate Astro components
- Use React function components over classes
- Use TypeScript with sound types and avoid any
- Prefer hooks whenever there's custom logic
- Use Zustand for state management
- For dictionary values, use `enum`
- Always use Tailwind 4 to add styles to components (both React and Astro)
- Always apply styles inspired by dark mode as default theme
- UI should be influenced by Fluent 2.0 design system
- Use lucide-react instead of inline svg
- Use 'size-\*' class in Tailwind when height and width are the same
- When referencing Github, always use 'przeprogramowani' organization and 'ai-rules-builder' repository
